Welcome to the 2024-2025 LBCSI Linux Diagnostic Image. Your performance in this image will determine which group (beginner/returner) you are placed in for training. Note that you will be able to move up (and move down) training groups, so if you are placed in beginner and you want to be in returner it is not the end of the world. The scorebot for this image is experimental and not similiar to the scorebots you have seen in other images and in CP-XVI. The way this scorebot works is through aliasing. Please do not remove the "score" alias from bash.bashrc, or else you will not be able to get your score. To see your score, type the command 'score' into the terminal, and it will report back to you what you have solved, and what you haven't solved. There are NO point values, your goal is just to solve every vulnerability. Once you are done, or at the end of the allowed time, send me a screenshot of your score report on discord. There will be injects, which I will announce.

Good luck, have fun.

Scenario: You (Koco) are tasked with ensuring the security of the LBCSI Leadership Team Ubuntu System. You should remove any unauthorized applications, files, and services. Updates aren't necessary, as the system is already as up to date as possible. Make sure that only the administrator users have admin access, and that their passwords are secure and up to standards. Ubuntu standard software and games are fine, but any externally installed games or software should be uninstalled immediately. Ensure that all users are in the correct groups, secure all the critical services, you know the drill. Oh, and HQ said NO SCRIPTS on this one, so just use your notes and checklists.

Critical services:
SSH
FTP
